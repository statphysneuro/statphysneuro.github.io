Ideas at the interface of statistical physics, information theory and
statistical learning have long influenced the development of concepts and
methods in neuroscience. In recent years, this contribution has mainly taken two
forms. One provides fundamental principles on which to base normative models
(what problem might the brain may be solving in a given context), and concrete
hypotheses about specific neural computations (how a certain problem may be
solved). This type of contribution thus provides tools for theory building. The
second type of contribution is more bottom-up, offering novel methods to think
about and analyze experimental recordings of neural activity and complex
behavior, or even to quantify aspects of the natural environment that are
relevant to neural information processing.

This workshop will bring together a diverse and interdisciplinary community
across physics, neuroscience, cognitive science and artificial intelligence, and
provide a forum for discussing recent developments and identifying new potential
collaborations. The small scale of the event (<50 people) will ensure an
informal and interactive atmosphere.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Statistical and dynamical models of computation in neuronal networks
- Inference methods for experimental recordings of neuronal activity and complex behavioral data
- Normative approaches to neural function, perception and cognition
- Neural coding

The workshop will be held on June 6-8 2022 at SISSA (Trieste, Italy), in hybrid
format. We are complementing the workshop with a special issue in the [Journal
of Physics A](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/1751-8121), which has a long
history of publishing articles at the interface between statistical physics and
neuroscience.
