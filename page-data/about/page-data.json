In recent years, this contribution has mainly taken two\nforms. One provides fundamental principles on which to base normative models\n(what problem might the brain may be solving in a given context), and concrete\nhypotheses about specific neural computations (how a certain problem may be\nsolved). This type of contribution thus provides tools for theory building. The\nsecond type of contribution is more bottom-up, offering novel methods to think\nabout and analyze experimental recordings of neural activity and complex\nbehavior, or even to quantify aspects of the natural environment that are\nrelevant to neural information processing.</p>\n<p>This workshop will bring together a diverse and interdisciplinary community\nacross physics, neuroscience, cognitive science and artificial intelligence, and\nprovide a forum for discussing recent developments and identifying new potential\ncollaborations. The small scale of the event (&#x3C;50 people) will ensure an\ninformal and interactive atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Statistical and dynamical models of computation in neuronal networks</li>\n<li>Inference methods for experimental recordings of neuronal activity and complex behavioral data</li>\n<li>Normative approaches to neural function, perception and cognition</li>\n<li>Neural coding</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The workshop will be held on June 6-8 2022 at SISSA (Trieste, Italy), in hybrid\nformat. We are complementing the workshop with a special issue in the <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/1751-8121\">Journal\nof Physics A</a>, which has a long\nhistory of publishing articles at the interface between statistical physics and\nneuroscience.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"id":"641c27b4-84fe-543d-96cb-012d20859b9f"}},
